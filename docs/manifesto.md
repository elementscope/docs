***Manifesto***

***This is the goal manifesto of the presented noun, which can be described as "medium", "platform", or "environment" created by me, the [author](https://www.github.com/sibjor/). I aim to describe possible future shapes of the "platform" or any element covered in it's scope. ["This shape"](https://www.github.com/elementscope) of the "medium" is a so called Github Organization, named "elementscope". You are granted member access and licence! ["A future shape"](https://www.github.com/elementscope/server) is availible today to anyone interested in developing a server or maybe front end that runs ons VPS at the our domain, https://www.elementscope.io/ The [philosophy](philosophy.md) and [principles](principles.md) used methods and workflows of creation agreed by myself only. A member license for any shape of this "platform" is published.***
