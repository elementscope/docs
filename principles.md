***Principles***

***This is the first version of the proposed principles of member based activity in the organization***
***Ill list the principles in numbered order***
1. Be humble to each other in a respectful way
2. You should feel invited to ask anything to me
3. You should feel invited to send any proposal to me
4. The more who agrees, the better right?
5. If a member without owner access to a repository wishes change stuff, he/she should create a branch and leave main and master to the owner.
6. The [docs](https://www.github.com/elementscope/docs/) should be access to all members, adding content by following agreed shared methods and workflows to main/master branch directly!
7. Add your principle by overwriting this line!
